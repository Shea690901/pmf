This directory contains sound files for the Sun Sparcstation. They are
usable with the "pmf" client available from this same place (130.236.254.13).
I also have an init file for lpmud.el that plays theses sounds. Tell me
if you want it.

Most of these files were conceived and performed during one night, filled
with giggles and chuckles. The main contributors are myself (Pell) and Kjell.
Other contributions by Padrone, Foul and Bellman. All of us are from NannyMud.
(130.236.254.13 2000). Here I'll try to describe what you hear.
