Changes in version 1.12
-----------------------

PMF version 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11 were very similar.
The only difference between them except some fixed memory leaks
and other minor changes was the command "frontcd".

But now, with version 1.12, there are many more changes.
The changes are mostly internal,
and the users shouldn't need to worry much about them,
but some things are different now:

1. Some of the /-commands
   (the commands you use in PMF when the flag slash_commands is set)
   have been changed to shorter forms, i. e.
   instead of /frontset, /fronthelp, /frontcd etc.,
   they are now called /set, /help and /cd instead.

2. slash_commands is now set to true as default,
   so if you want (near-)compatibility with older versions of PMF,
   you should put the line "/unset slash_commands"
   first in your init file (".pmfrc"),
   But "frontset" etc is only called "set" now.

3. When a robot action results in several commands being sent to MUD,
   they are now sent in the right order.
