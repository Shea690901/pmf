   lennes@sumter.cso.uiuc.edu is the person who modified pmf to compile under
NeXTstep 2.0 using XNeXT. To compile on the NeXT, just follow the instructions
in pmf.doc and ignore the compiler warnings. To use sound mode on the NeXT,
look at the file Sndconvert.README; it contains instructions on how to convert
the sounds from the Sun .au format to NeXT .snd. pmf 1.9 and the sound files
are also available at beowulf.acc.stolaf.edu here in the States.
