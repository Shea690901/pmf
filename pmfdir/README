This is the README file for PMF, Padrone's MudFrontend.

PMF stands for Padrone's MudFilter, and is a frontend, also known as a client,
for playing MUD. It was developed for LPmud, but there should be nothing to
prevent it from being used with other types of MUD games.

The file "doc/pmf.doc" contains the documentation for PMF,
including information on where you get it from,
and how to compile and install it on your system.
