# A small example of an PMF init file.
# Thomas Padron-McCarhty, padrone@lysator.liu.se, Sept 21 1991
# Remember that all blank lines are sent to MUD, which means that you
# should probably NOT have any blank lines in the init file.
# Silent mode is on while running the init file.
#
#
# First of all, set up some things:
#
/set prompt "pmf %d> "
/set history 40
/set lines_to_save 100
/set cryptkey "Have a Coke and a Smile!"
#
# Some very useful aliases:
#
/alias c score
/alias l look
/alias g get all
/alias ec exa corpse
/alias dc drop corpse
/alias sb sell bottle
/alias m missile
/alias k shock
/alias f fireball
/alias gc "get $1 from corpse $2"
/alias gb "get $1 from bag $2"
/alias bdb "buy beer $n drink beer"
/alias h history
#
# This alias lets you run from the church to the pub:
#
/alias church-to-pub "perform s > $n perform e > $n perform e > $n perform n > $n perform e >"
#
# Avoid printing some of the more annoying messages:
#
# /gag "Go player says: "
# /gag "Harry says: "
#
# A simple robot action:
#
# /action "$1 died" "get corpse $n /echo You took the corpse of $1."
# /set robot
