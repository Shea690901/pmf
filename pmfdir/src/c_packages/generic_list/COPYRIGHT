Copyright and all that boring stuff
-----------------------------------

This code, the "generic lists etc" package, is distributed without any
form of copyright or license. You can change, re-distribute or throw
away this code, and you can put it in a small box and sit on it.
Noone will sue you. Share and enjoy!

However, even if I haven't bothered with copyrights and stuff, I have
made a deal with an evil demon from hell who calls himself Hugo den Grymme.
In return for letting him use my program (plus some help regarding
virgins that I'd rather not discuss here), he has agreed to take care of
anyone who does things to the program that I don't like.

So, if you steal my program and sell it, if you find out some way to make
money from it and don't give that money to me, if you claim that it was
you and not I who wrote it, or if you make changes to it and re-distribute
it without changing the version number, Hugo den Grymme will come for you.
As I wrote above, noone will sue you, but your immortal soul is in danger.

Naturally, the code comes without any warranty. Hugo doesn't like warranties.
