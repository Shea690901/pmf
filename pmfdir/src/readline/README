This is a README file written by the author of pmf, a program using
the GNU readline library.

Note that all copyright, licensing, warranty etc needed
under the GNU license, under which the GNU readline library
is distributed, applies.

I have copied the source to the GNU readline library from the source
code of GNU bash 1.05. I copied all the files from the directory with
the readline library, and added the file COPYING from the bash directory.
I have also added this README file.
