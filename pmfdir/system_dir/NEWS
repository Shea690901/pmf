	A new version of PMF (1.12.1) has been installed!
	One of the features is this news file -- wonderful, isn't it?
	If you don't want to see it, give the flag "-n" (for "no news") to pmf.
	Another useful flag for PMF is "-s" (to stifle its verbosity).
	Important: From now on all PMF commands start with a slash ("/"),
	so you should type
		/alias  h  /history
	instead of
		alias  h  history
	Read the documentation is in "~tompa/pmfdir/doc/pmf.doc"
	(or use the PMF command "/help").
