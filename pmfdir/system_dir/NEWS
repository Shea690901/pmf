	This is version 1.13 of PMF.
	Not much has changed since the previous version.
	If you don't want to see this news file, give the flag "-n"
	(for "no news") to pmf.
	Another useful flag for PMF is "-s" (to stifle its verbosity).
	Read the documentation (in the file called "pmf.doc"),
	or use the PMF command "/help".
