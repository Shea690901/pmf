        Syntax:  /action  [ PATTERN  [ ACTION ] ]

        Define a robot action.
        This is an example of how this command can be (mis-)used:
            /action "$1 arrives" "kick $L1 $n say Eat my sword, $1! $n kill $L1"
        With no arguments, all robot actions are listed.
        To turn on the robot mode, you have to set the "robot" flag to true:
            /set robot
        To turn the robot mode off, use the command "/unset":
            /unset robot

        See also:  /unaction, /unactionall, robot
