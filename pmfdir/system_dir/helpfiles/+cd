        Syntax:  /cd  [ DIRECTORY ]

        Changes the current directory of the PMF process to DIRECTORY.
        The command "/system cd DIRECTORY" wouldn't work, since that would
        only change the current directory in a subshell.
        Other commands, like "/system pwd" and "/system ls -a",
        work as they should, though.
