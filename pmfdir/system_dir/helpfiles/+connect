        Syntax:  /connect  [ HOST  [ PORT ] ]

        This command connects to a MUD game on port PORT at host HOST.
        Usually this is done automatically when PMF has finished reading
        the init file, but it can be used in the init file so remote
        commands can be used in the init file.
