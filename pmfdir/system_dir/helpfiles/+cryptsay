        Syntax:  /cryptsay  STRING

        Encrypted communication between players on LPmud games.

        The command "/cryptsay" uses the encryption key given in the
        variable "/cryptkey" to encrypt STRING, yielding ENCRYPTED-STRING.
        The command
                say PMF_CRYPTSAY: ENCRYPTED-STRING
        is then sent to the MUD game.

        When another PMF program receives such a line, it is decrypted
        using the value of "cryptkey" (if set),
        and then printed in decrypted form.

        Obviously, you and your partner must have the same cryptkey.

        WARNING 1: The encryption is simple and can probably be broken easily,
                   at least if you know something about such things.

        WARNING 2: You still have to transmit the key in some way,
                   and someone could be listening then too.
