        Syntax:  /crypttell  NAME  STRING

        Encrypted communication between two players on LPmud games.

        The command "/crypttell" uses the encryption key given in the
        variable "/cryptkey" to encrypt STRING, yielding ENCRYPTED-STRING.
        The command
                tell NAME PMF_CRYPTSAY: ENCRYPTED-STRING
        is then sent to the MUD game.

        When another PMF program receives such a line, it is decrypted
        using the value of "cryptkey" (if set),
        and then printed in de-crypted form.

        Obviously, you and your partner must have the same cryptkey.
