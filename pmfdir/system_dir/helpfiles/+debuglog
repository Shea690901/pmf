        Syntax:  /debuglog  [ FILENAME ]

        This command is similar to /log, i. e.
        all messages sent to and received from the MUD game will be
        written on the file FILENAME,
        but with some extra info about what was sent and received,
        and when.
        Exit log mode by giving the command "/debuglog" (or "/log")
        without an argument.
