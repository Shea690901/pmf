        Syntax:  /dump  FILENAME

        This command will write all alias definitions, variable values,
        robot actions and gagged players to the file FILENAME.
        This file is in a format suitable for the "/source" command,
        so the command "/dump" can be used to save your customization
        of PMF between sessions, or when creating an init file.
