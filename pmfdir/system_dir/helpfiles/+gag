        Syntax:  /gag  [ PATTERN ]

        Gag a player, i. e. don't print what that player does or says.
        PMF tries, however, to always print any messages about attacks and
        fighting, but this mechanism can be defeated.
        With no arguments, all gags are listed.

        Since the lines from MUD is matched against PATTERN in the same way
        as when looking for robot actions to do, the "gag" command can be
        used to shut out shouting, fireballs etc.
