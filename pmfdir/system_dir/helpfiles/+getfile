        Syntax: getfile  REMOTE-FILE-NAME  [ LOCAL-FILE-NAME ]

        (LPmud-specific)

        This command gets a file from LPmud using the built-in editor ed
        to print it. What it does is basically to do these commands, plus
        the appropriate waiting when needed:

                system "mv LOCAL-FILE-NAME LOCAL-FILE-NAME.bak"
                ed REMOTE-FILE-NAME
                $=
        and, for each ten lines (with line numbers N to M) in the file,
                N,Mp
        and finally
                Q

        If the flag "show_receive" is true,
        all the text printed by the LPmud game while this is done is shown
        on the screen, which might sometimes be confusing.
        You can interrupt an active "/getfile" command by typing CTRL-C.
