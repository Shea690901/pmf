        Syntax:  /help  [ SUBJECT ]

        The command "/help" is the help command used by PMF.
        It is not simply called "help", since that command is used by LPmud.
        Typing "/help SUBJECT" will print some information about SUBJECT,
        and "/help" without an argument, or "/help pmf",
        or "help pmf", will get you some short info about PMF, and a list of
        available commands.
        Help requests are (usually) not case-sensitive, so
        "/help pmf", "/help Pmf" and "/help PMF" should all work.

        Use "/help ?" to see what subjects you can get help about!
