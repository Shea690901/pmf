        Syntax:  /putfile  LOCAL-FILE-NAME  [ REMOTE-FILE-NAME ]

        (LPmud-specific)

        This command sends a file to LPmud using the built-in editor ed.
        What it does is basically to do these commands, plus
        the appropriate waiting when needed:
        
                ed REMOTE-FILE-NAME
                1,$d
                i
                send LOCAL-FILE-NAME *
                w REMOTE-FILE-NAME
                .
                Q

        All the text printed by the LPmud game while this is done is shown
        on the screen -- like the error messages we get if the remote file
        did not exist previously.

        You can interrupt an active "/putfile" command by typing CTRL-C.
