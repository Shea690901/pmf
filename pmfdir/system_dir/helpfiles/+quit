        Syntax:  /quit

        The command "/quit" exits from the PMF program, but you will still
        be logged in on the MUD game, as a "linkdead" character
        (at least if the MUD server doesn't detect that you are
        disconnected and logs you out automatically).
        You should probably use the quit command in the MUD game instead.
        In LPmud, it is called "quit".
