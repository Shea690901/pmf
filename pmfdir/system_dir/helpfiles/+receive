        Syntax:  /receive  FILENAME  STOP-TOKEN

        The file FILENAME is opened for writing, and lines are read from
        MUD and written to that file until STOP-TOKEN is received.
        STOP-TOKEN must be one word, i. e. it must be quoted if it contains
        blanks.

        When matching STOP-TOKEN against output lines, the STOP-TOKEN
        must either appear at the beginning of a line, with no leading text
        or white space, or it must be a pattern that can be "dollar-matched"
        (as in the robot actions) against the output lines.

        If the flag "show_receive" is false, the received lines are not
        printed on the screen, but instead a dot is printed for each line
        that is received.
        You can interrupt an active "/receive" command by typing CTRL-C.
