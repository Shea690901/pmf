        Syntax:  /send  FILENAME  [ ACCEPT-TOKEN ]

        The lines from the file are read and sent directly to MUD.
        They are NOT interpreted by the MudFrontend program.
        The commands will NOT appear on the history list.

        After a line has been sent, the MudFrontend will wait for MUD
        to print a line starting with ACCEPT-TOKEN, or just any line
        if no ACCEPT-TOKEN is given.
        ACCEPT-TOKEN must be one word, i. e. it must be quoted if it contains
        blanks, and it must appear at the beginning of a line, with no
        leading text or white space, or it will be dollar-matched.

        A dot is printed on the terminal for each line that is sent.
        You can interrupt an active "/send" command by typing CTRL-C.
