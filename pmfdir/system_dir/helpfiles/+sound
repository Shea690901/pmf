        Syntax:  /sound  [ PATTERN [ FILENAME ] ]

        If you are playing from a SUN SPARCstation, you can use PMF
        to add the dimension of sound to the MUD game.
        The command "/sound" defines a sound action.
        When a line that matches PATTERN is received from the MUD game,
        and the variable "sound" is true, PMF will send the sound contained
        in the file FILENAME to the loudspeaker of your SUN SPARCstation.

        With no arguments, all sound actions are listed.
        To turn on the sound mode, you have to set the "sound" flag to true:
                /set sound
        and to turn it off, you must set it to false:
                /unset sound

        This command has no effect if PMF has not been compiled for using
        the sound mode.
