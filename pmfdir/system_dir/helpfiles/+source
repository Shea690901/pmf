        Syntax:  /source  FILENAME

        The lines from the file are read and executed, in the same way as if
        they had been typed on the terminal. Commands to PMF will be
        interpreted and executed (including other levels of "/source"
        commands), and the other commands will be sent to the MUD game.
        History substitution is NOT done on the lines from the file,
        and the commands will NOT appear on the history list.
        A dot is printed on the terminal for each executed line.
