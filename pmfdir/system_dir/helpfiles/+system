        Syntax: system COMMAND

        This command executes the command COMMAND in a Unix shell.

        Typing "system" without an argument will start your favorite
        shell as a child-process to PMF. When you leave the shell,
        you will be back in PMF.

        Note that PMF will sleep until the system command is finished,
        and if you use it to run a sub-shell a lot of things can happen
        in the game while you are away.
