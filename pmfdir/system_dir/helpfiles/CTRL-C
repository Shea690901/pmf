        CTRL-C

        When you type CTRL-C in PMF, all active "/send" and "/receive"
        commands (including "/getfile" and "/putfile") are terminated,
        all lines on the queue to be sent to the MUD game are thrown away,
        and you get back to the command mode,
        and (if the variable "prompt" is defined) PMF will print a prompt.
