        CTRL-Z

        On many UNIX systems, if you type CTRL-Z while in PMF,
        the process will be temporarily suspended, and you will be
        returned to the shell.
        You can restart PMF later, by typing "%N", there N is the
        job number of PMF. Use the command "jobs" (in the UNIX shell)
        to see what number it has.
