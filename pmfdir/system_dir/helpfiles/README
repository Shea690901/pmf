In this directory the help files for PMF's on-line help function
are stored. In PMF, the command
        /help SUBJECT
will print the help file on SUBJECT.

The help files for subjects starting with "/", as the commands do,
should start with "+" instead.
The help files should usually have lowercase names.

If you add new help files, you should also edit the file "?".

If a help request, say "FOO" isn't found, it's tried with a "/",
i. e. "/FOO", and then in lowercase, i. e. "/foo".
Help file names should usually be in lower case.
