        Read the section "Known bugs" in the documentation,
        and report additional problems to me.

        Bug reports can be sent by email to padrone@lysator.liu.se.
        Please try to describe how the bug manifested itself,
        excatly what commands you gave, what you think caused the bug,
        and (important!) the VERSION of PMF you are using, plus the
        configuration (you could, for example, include both the
        .pmfrc file and a file created by the "dump" command).

        There might be a command in the MUD game called "bug",
        but if you need more info about that you must use the help
        facilities in the MUD game.
