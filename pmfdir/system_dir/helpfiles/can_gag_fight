        Variable:  can_gag_fight

        The variable "can_gag_fight" controls gagging, i. e.
	the suppression of certain messages from the MUD game.
	Normally, it is not possible to stop messages about fighting
	("Harry hits you", "Balrog tickles you in the stomach"),
	but if "can_gag_fight" is set to true, you can stop such messages.
