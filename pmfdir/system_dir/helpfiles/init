        When PMF is started, it tries to read a file named ".pmfrc" in your
        HOME directory. If that file doesn't exist, it looks for a standard
        init file (whose name was defined when PMF was compiled).
        It is also possible to give another file name,
        using the -f flag, when starting PMF.
