        The syntax for starting PMF is:

                pmf [ -FLAGS ] [ -f INITFILE ]
                    [ [ HOSTNAME | HOST-IP-ADDRESS ] [ PORTNUMBER ] ]

        If HOSTNAME and/or HOST-IP-ADDRESS is not given, PMF will connect to
        the host and port supplied in the init file, and, if none, to the
        default host and port that were defined when PMF was compiled and
        installed (the constants DEFAULT_HOST_STRING and DEFAULT_PORT_STRING
        in the file config.h).

        FLAGS can be X, which means X-windows mode (not very advanced, really),
        or d, meaning to turn ON the debug flag from start,
        or n, meaning to NOT print the local news file when starting PMF,
        or s, meaning to turn OFF the verbose flag from start,
        or 2, meaning 2-window mode (not implemented yet).
