        The command "quit" is used by LPmud. This command is not intercepted
        by PMF, it is simply passed on to LPmud.
        Note that if you are not at the LPmud command prompt (">"),
        LPmud will probably not understand the command.
        If you type CTRL-D to PMF, or give the local command "/quit",
        the connection will be broken,
        but you will still be logged in on the game (but "link-dead").

        See also:  /quit
