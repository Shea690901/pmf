        Variable:  show_receive

        Usually all text from the MUD game is printed on the player's
        screen, except for lines filtered out by gags (see "/gag").
        This can be irritating when a lot of text is sent, as when
        receiving a file using "/receive" or "/getfile".

        If this variable is changed to false, with the command
                /unset show_receive
        text received from MUD while doing a "/receive" or "/getfile"
        command will NOT be printed on the screen.

        See also:  /set, /unset, variables, /receive, /getfile, /gag
