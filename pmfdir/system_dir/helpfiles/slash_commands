        Variable:  slash_commands

        When "slash_commands" is true (this is the default),
        the PMF commands are supposed to start with a slash ("/"), like this:
                /alias kh "kick harry"
        but if it is set to false, commands are not supposed to start
        with a slash:
                alias kh "kick harry"

        Note that alias expansion is performed on the line first,
        so you can define aliases like
                alias /history history
                alias history /history
                alias frontset /set

        See also:  /set, /unset, variables, /alias
