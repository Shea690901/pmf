        There are some variables in PMF, and their values
        effect the behaviour of the MudFrontend.

        The variables are:
                achtung  cryptkey  debug  history  host  ignoreeof
                lines_to_save  port  prompt  replace_control  robot
                screen_length  show_receive  slash_commands  sound
                substitute_history  verbose
        and also (probably not of any use to you, puny mortal):
                internal_debug  ipc_debug

        Use "/set" and "/unset" to change the values of the variables.
        "/set" with no arguments prints a list of all variables.

        See also:  /set, /unset
